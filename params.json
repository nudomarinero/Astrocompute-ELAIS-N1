{"name":"Astrocompute ELAIS-N1","tagline":"","body":"# Astrocompute ELAIS-N1\r\n\r\nInformation about the [SKA](https://www.skatelescope.org/)-[AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) [Astrocompute proposal](https://www.skatelescope.org/ska-aws-astrocompute-call-for-proposals/) called: \"Calibration of LOFAR ELAIS-N1 data in the Amazon cloud\". Maintained by J. Sabater (Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh).\r\n\r\n## LOFAR AMIs\r\nWe have created an AMI with the LOFAR software pre-installed: `ami-63b89309`. It is based on the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS official AMI.\r\n\r\nSoftware installed:\r\n* casacore libraries.\r\n* casarest libraries.\r\n* pyrap.\r\n* LOFAR software (release 2.15).\r\n* [CASA](http://casa.nrao.edu/).\r\n* [LSMTool](https://github.com/darafferty/LSMTool).\r\n* [LoSoTo](https://github.com/revoltek/losoto).\r\n* [factor](https://github.com/revoltek/factor).\r\n* [WSClean](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wsclean/).\r\n* [Montage](http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html).\r\n* [Sagecal](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sagecal/)\r\n* Some additional Python libraries like [astropy](http://www.astropy.org/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), etc.\r\n\r\nThere is also an AMI (`ami-ccbd96a6`) with some more additional software installed that can be used as, for example, a head node. The additional software is:\r\n* GRID certificates and tools.\r\n* SRM tools.\r\n* AWS tools and Python libraries.\r\n* Postgresql 8.4.10 required by some LOFAR BBS tasks.\r\n\r\n### Legacy AMIs\r\nWe keep some old AMIs for compatibility reasons:\r\n* LOFAR 2.12 node: `ami-431b6229`\r\n* LOFAR 2.12 head: `ami-47156c2d`\r\n* LOFAR 2.10 node: `ami-c7a3c3a2`\r\n* LOFAR 2.10 head: `ami-69dfab0c`\r\n\r\n### Packaging of LOFAR\r\nThe [radio-astro Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~radio-astro/+archive/ubuntu/main) keeps all the LOFAR dependencies packaged and updated. However, we decided to independently generate the LOFAR package for each release to maintain control of the compilation process. \r\nThe generation of the packages is explained in: https://github.com/nudomarinero/Astrocompute-ELAIS-N1/tree/master/vagrant","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
